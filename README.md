### Welcome to my GitHub page!

## About me
My name is Matteo Cipolla, I'm a student from 42 school network. I discovered coding late in my life but now i can't live without it.
My hobby are reading and writing, I also really enjoy traveling around and be in contact with nature.

## Current knowledge
Through the 42 program I've learned basic shell functionality, as well as a robust **C** and **C++** programming knowledge(although C++ version was 98, so pretty different from modern C++).
We also dived into **Docker** and **Docker-compose**, **Makefile** and some basic **HTTP Protocol** behavior.
Throught this journey I've learned how to:
- C standard functions works by replicating them (and discover why/where they're unsafe)
- How to I/O works, how to read from stdin/files and write to stdout/files, understanding what file descriptor are and how they works.
- Virtual Machine
- Some basic **Sorting Algorithm** given specific conditions (LIS implementation)
- Simple 2D graphic representation throught a custom graphic library
- Work with multiple threads/processes, and the different between them
- Increasing my knowledge how bash works replicating its main functionality!
- Basic networking knowledge about IP addresses and subnet masks
- Understanding how 3D rasterization works, and how to represent basic solids shapes on a virtual plane, including ray-tracing dynamic
- OOP mechanincs such as **Class**, **Polymorphism**, **Inheritance**, **Interfaces** and so on
- How C++ containers works by replicating them (including Red-Black trees)
- How HTTP 1.1 protocol works by implementing a fully functional C++ Webserver
- Using Docker to Virtualize Services
- Build a Webapp using **NestJs**, implementing Google OAuth, an inside chat, a **Database** and an online game (yes, Pong, again!)

## Special Projects mentions:
# Pipex
This project is usally skipped in favor of Minitalk, for it's complexity. You need to implement C Pipe(). That's it. You need to handle multiples pipe, even endless. This really gives you a deep understanding on how FD works, and how asynchronicity works.
Hard as hell for a beginner. But I was so proud when it finally worked. And it really helped for project you will find below

# Minishell
This was without any doubt one of my most loved project, and probably the one I'm most proud of!
In this project you're asked to build a bash shell with some built-in commands.
It was the first incredibly big project, and incredibly hard. But I seriously think my Minishell works really similar to the original one. No gimmicks, no tricks. It just do what it has to do. You can find the project in my repositories

# Minirt
Well well, this one was hard. My math knowledge wasn't nearly so deep to understand linear algebra and this level of geomerty. So i had to go back studying. I bought some books about raytracing, and after many weeks of trying I slowly started to understand something about it.
Not gonna lie: this project is incredibly hard. But the statisfaction when you start to render spheres and planes and cones and so on with **your** renderer is incredible. No much to say about this one, you can check everything you need in my repositories as well!

## Aim and Ambitions
My personal preferences are Low level programming, especially OS. Since I'm very aware that I lack all the knowledge about this, I started studying on my own Assembly language and how to interface with the hardware. It's still a long journey but I can't stop to find it interesting and fascinating!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **ft_ls**: 42 project to replicate the famous ls shell command with flags!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: modern C++ by building a custon database!
